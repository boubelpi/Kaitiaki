        ***LIABILITY***
        If we fail to comply with these Terms we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these Terms or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but subject to paragraph 14.4, we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time you accepted these Terms, both we and you knew it might happen ("Foreseeable Losses"); and
        
        Subject to paragraph 14.4, we limit our aggregate liability for Foreseeable Losses, arising out of or in connection with these Terms, to you in respect of all events occurring in any calendar year, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), for breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, to the greater of:
        100% of the fees paid and payable by you to us in respect of the App in such calendar year; and
        Â£50.
        
        Subject to paragraph 14.4, circumstances giving rise to a loss or damage which is not foreseeable includes but shall not be limited to:
        any use of our Apps in a manner that we do not authorise;
        ending, suspending or restricting use of our Apps in accordance with these Terms;
        any loss or damage caused by us in circumstances where there is no breach of contractual obligation or legal duty owed to you by us;
        any loss or damage (including to any device or content belonging to you) caused by us to the extent that such loss or damage results from your negligence, your failure to follow our reasonable instructions or any other breach of these Terms (or any other contract you have in place with us), unless we were in breach of a legal obligation or duty of care owed to you by us and that breach is the substantial cause of the loss or damage;
        any loss or damage caused by any error, bugs or viruses arising in your use of our Apps that are not directly caused by or attributable to our Apps, or any incompatibility of our Apps with any other software, hardware or material on your device; and
        any breach of paragraphs 6 or 10 by you.
        
        Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury arising from our negligence, or our fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under English law.
        
        If defective digital content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you, we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage that you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions or to have in place the technical requirements advised by us.
        
        Our Apps are for domestic and private use only. If you use our Apps for any commercial, business or resale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.
        
        Please note that in some jurisdictions consumer protection laws may not allow certain disclaimers or exclusions or limitations of liability and consequently some of the disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability in these Terms may not apply.
        
        We recommend that you back up any content and data used in connection with our Apps, to protect yourself in case of problems with our Apps.
        
        Our Apps have not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of our Apps (as described on the app stores where ours Apps are available and in the related documentation) meet your requirements.
        
        If our provision of support for our Apps is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event but you may terminate these Terms by ceasing to use our Apps and deleting or removing it from your device.
        
        Our Apps, which are available on various app stores, are controlled and offered by us from our facilities on Cyprus. The distribution of our Apps via app stores is governed by their rules with which we must comply. There are some locations where Apps with paid for in-app purchasing products are not permitted and therefore in those locations our Apps will not be visible to app store users registered in those locations.
        
        You agree that you will compensate us for any losses (including reasonable legal fees) that we incur as a result of any breach of paragraph 6 or 10 by you.
        
        ***YOUR PRIVACY***
        We only use any personal data we collect through your use of our Apps in the ways set out in our Privacy Policy which can be found here.
        
        Please be aware that internet transmissions are never completely private or secure and that any message or information you send using our Apps may be read or intercepted by others, even if there is a special notice that a particular transmission is encrypted.
        
        By using our Apps, you agree to us collecting and using technical information about the devices you use our Apps on and related software, hardware and peripherals to improve our products.
        
        ***THIRD PARTY WEBSITES***
        You acknowledge that our Apps may contain links to third party websites (whether by way of advertisements or otherwise) that are not owned or controlled by us. Such links are provided for your reference only. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for the contents or your use of them, and as a result we do not accept responsibility for the availability, suitability, reliability or content of such third party websites.
        
        Our inclusion of such hyperlinks in our Apps does not imply any endorsement of the material or the views expressed within them.
        
        ***SUPPORT***

        ***ADVERTISING AND MONETISATION***
        You acknowledge that our Apps and the App Content may be supported by advertising revenues and we may place advertising, promotions or sponsored content on our Apps or on, about, or in conjunction with the App Content. You acknowledge that we may not always identify advertising, promotions and sponsored content and the manner, mode and extent of such advertising, promotions and sponsored content is subject to change without notice to you. We may at our sole discretion provide the ability to pay to remove advertisements via the settings menu within our Apps.
        
        ***CHANGES TO OUR APPS***
        From time to time we may automatically update our Apps to improve performance, enhance functionality, reflect changes to the operating system or address security issues.
        
        If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using our Apps.
        
        Changes to our Apps will not prevent our Apps working with the versions of the operating system shown on the app store that you downloaded the App from.
        
        ***CHANGES TO THESE TERMS***
        These Terms may only be modified with our prior written consent. We may alter or amend these Terms, including introducing new terms, that are:
        (a) the result of a change in applicable law or our business; (b) necessary for the provision of our Apps; or (c) the result of any improvements to our Apps. Subject to paragraph 20.3, if we make any changes (including any changes to our policies), we will give thirty (30) days' prior written notice to you by email. If you notify us in writing within the thirty (30) days that you do not accept the change, these Terms will terminate immediately.
        
        However, if you continue to use our Apps after providing such notice or after the thirty (30) day period, you are accepting these Terms as updated.
        
        We are under no obligation to notify you of any changes to these Terms that result in minor adjustments or corrections to these Terms.
        
        ***TRANSFER OF RIGHTS***
        We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the these Terms.
        
        You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.
        
        ***TERMINATION***
        These Terms apply from when you click "I Accept" at the bottom of this screen (the "Effective Date") and will remain in full force and effect while you use our Apps until terminated in accordance with this paragraph 22.
        
        We may terminate these Terms and your use of our Apps, or suspend your use of our Apps, immediately by written notice to you if:
        we consider that you have used our Apps in violation of these Terms;
        we believe there has been unauthorised access to our Apps;
        we, at our sole discretion, decide to withdraw our Apps (whether in whole or in part);
        we have a legal or regulatory obligation imposed on us, which impacts our ability to provide our Apps; or
        for any other reason provided that we have given you thirty (30) days' written notice by email, SMS or via an electronic communication within our Apps.
        
        We may discontinue licensing any of the App Content at any time at our sole discretion. In this instance you will be able to continue to use our Apps with the App Content, but it will no longer be available on app stores and will no longer be supported by us.
        
        You can terminate these Terms by ceasing to use our Apps and deleting or uninstalling it from your device.
        
        Upon termination for any reason:
        all rights granted to you under these Terms cease (however, any liabilities incurred by you under these Terms prior shall survive any such termination);
        you must cease all activities authorised by these Terms; and
        you must delete or remove our Apps from your device.
        
        ***GENERAL***
        This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to allow anyone other than you or us to enforce any term of these Terms or of the Privacy Policy.
        
        Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
        
        These Terms are governed by English law (including non-contractual disputes or claims) and legal proceedings in respect of these Terms and our Apps shall be dealt with exclusively by the English courts.
        
        If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the relevant provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, and the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions which will remain in full force and effect.
        
        Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have, you acknowledge and agree that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of these Terms by you. Accordingly, we shall be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of these Terms.
