            What is CO2e?
            While carbon dioxide (CO2) holds a prominent role as a greenhouse gas, it is not the sole contributor to climate change. Various other gases also play a part in driving global warming. These gases are collectively measured using a single metric known as CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent).
